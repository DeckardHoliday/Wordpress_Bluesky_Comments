# Wordpress_Bluesky_Comments
Use Bluesky replies as comments on your Wordpress Posts!

## Features
- Styles Bluesky post replies to look like comments on your WordPress Post
- Nested Replies Support

## Workflow
This plugin does not create a Bluesky post on your behalf. I find the best workflow for this is:
- Create and publish your WordPress post
- Create your BlueSky post
- Update your WordPress post to add this block and include the Bluesky Post's URL

## Requirements
These requirements are conservative. This plugin may work on an older version of Wordpress, but I can't guarantee it!

- WordPress 6.8.2 or higher
- PHP 8.2.29 or higher

## Manual Installation

To manually install this plugin:

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from releases.

2. Extract the contents of the ZIP (if applicable).

3. Upload the plugin folder to your WordPress site's `wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP or file manager.

4. Activate the plugin:
- Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
- Go to `Plugins > Installed Plugins`
- Find plugin name in the list and click `Activate`

## Usage

Once activated:

1. Go to your post edit page.
2. Add the "Bluesky Comments" block
3. Add the URL of the reference post
4. Done! Use the tools in the block editor to tweak how it looks.

## Updating the Plugin

To update manually:

1. Download the latest version from GitHub
2. Delete the old plugin folder from `wp-content/plugins/`
3. Upload the new version in its place
4. Re-activate if needed
